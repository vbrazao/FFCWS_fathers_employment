# Note on reproducibility

We attempted to make this work computationally reproducible by providing all code and outputs on GitHub, using the `groundhog` package within each script to ensure the same package versions are installed and loaded independent of the user, and detailing how one might go about trying to reproduce our work in the README.

Further, we asked freelancer Niels Markwat, PhD ([ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9884-0707)), to attempt to reproduce our analyses with the code available on GitHub, an experience which helped us further improve the reproducibility of this repository.

The reproducibility report produced by Niels is saved in this folder in PDF. After this report, we solved issues by private communication.

Working with Niels, we were able to learn the following things:

-   When used within Quarto documents, `groundhog` can cause an error that is easy to miss: rendering the document for the first time, it will most likely halt execution without giving the user any reason why. Trying to render again should then work. We added a note to the README to that effect, so others can know what to expect.

-   If you forget to add a package that is required for a Quarto document (or R script) to run to the list of packages called by `groundhog`, it will unsurprisingly result in an error. We added "modelsummary" to the list where it was missing.

-   Even though we used `set.seed()` in the script that imputes missing data (`02_wrangle-data.R`), the resulting datasets were not identical. As of now we don't know why. Otherwise, datasets generated by our code were successfully reproduced.

-   Data delineation, descriptive reports, and analytic results were successfully reproduced. No surprises there.
